CS5040 Linked List Problem


Linked List
This problem and concept was extremely difficult for me to understand at first. It took a while, but it was worth it in the end. The program created a menu. The menue had options pertaining to add nodes at specific points in a linked list. You could also remove the nodes at specific points in the linked list (add node at head, at tail, or at a specific index). After every change was made via the menu, the program would spit out the linked list before the change and after the change. It also had the option to Exit the Program and Print List Size

Please let me know how I can improve the code. Thank you.
